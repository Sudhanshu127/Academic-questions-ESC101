Given 3 rectangles with their topleft and bottomright points}
{find thesum of their areas without using structures.}{24}

Can you do the above problem for 20 rectangles with}

\myentrya{
 Aladin has been given two line segments (defined uniquely by two endpoints).}{
  He turns to you to ask if the segments intersect or not. Can you help him?}
{19}
\myentryb{INPUT: Two line segments, each containing four floating point numbers, }{denoting the X1, Y1, X2 and Y2 respectively}{19}

\myentryc{OUTPUT: In case the line segments do not intersect, print "No".}{ Otherwise, print "Yes"}{19}

Create an array of 10 nodes.Store your name in these nodes and link them}{
 in series.Using the initial node surf through the nodes and print the characters in each.}{18}
